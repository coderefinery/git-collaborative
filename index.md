# Collaborative distributed version control

In this lesson we will learn how to keep repositories in sync and how to work
with remote repositories on GitHub and other services. We will discover 
and exercise the fork-pull request (or merge request) workflow, and finally 
look into how to automate tasks using Git hooks.

We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
choose to host your Git repository on another platform.

We also encourage course participants to use our new [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
for more information see [http://coderefinery.org/repository/](http://coderefinery.org/repository/).


## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Git.

2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
