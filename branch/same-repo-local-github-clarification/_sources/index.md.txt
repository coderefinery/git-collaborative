# Collaborative distributed version control

We have learned how to work with a Git repository used by a single person. What
about sharing and collaborating?

- Share the folder using email or using some file sharing service:
  This would lead to many back and forth emails and would be difficult
  to keep all copies synchronized.
- One personâ€™s repository on the web: Allows one person to keep track of
  more projects, gain visibility, feedback, and recognition.
- **Common repository for a group**: Everyone can directly update the same repository.
  Good for small groups.
- Forks or copies with different owners: Anyone can suggest changes, even without
  advance permission. Maintainers approve what they agree with.

Being able to share more easily (going down the above list) is
*transformative* (easier to change something, that is you are not the sole owner)
because it allows projects to scale to a new level.

We will **discover and exercise the most typical workflows when collaborating**
using services like GitHub.


:::{prereq}
1. Basic understanding of Git.
2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow similar workflows and
basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With this
material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a
number of concepts using examples with
[GitHub](https://github.com) because it is currently the most
popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is
high that you will interact with
[GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you choose
to host your Git repository on another platform.
