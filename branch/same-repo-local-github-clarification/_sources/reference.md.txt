## Glossary

git hook

## Commands we use

This excludes most introduced in the [git-intro
cheatsheet](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/reference/).

Setup:

* `git clone URL [TARGET-DIRECTORY]`: Make a copy of existing
  repository at &lt;url&gt;, containing all history.

Status:

* `git status`: Same as in basic git, list status
* `git remote [-v]`: List all remotes
* `git graph`: see a detailed graph of commits.  Create this command
  with `git config --global alias.graph "log --all --graph --decorate --oneline"`

General work:

* `git switch BRANCH-NAME`: Make a branch active.
* `git push [REMOTE-NAME] [BRANCH:BRANCH]`: Send commits and
  update the branch on the remote.
* `git pull [REMOTE-NAME] [BRANCH-NAME]`: Fetch and then merge
  automatically.  Can be convenient, but to be careful you can fetch
  and merge separately.
* `git fetch [REMOTE-NAME]`: Get commits from the remote.  Doesn't
  update local branches, but updates the remote tracking branches
  (like origin/NAME).
* `git merge [BRANCH-NAME]`: Updates your current branch with
  changes from another branch.  By default, merges to the branch is is
  tracking by default.
* `git remote add REMOTE-NAME URL`: Adds a new remote with a
  certain name.
