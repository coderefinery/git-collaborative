Collaborative distributed version control
=========================================

We have learned how to make a Git repository for a single person. What
about sharing?

- Share the folder using email or using some file sharing service:
  This would lead to many back and forth emails and would be difficult
  keep all copies synchronized.
- One person’s repository on the web: allows one person to keep track of
  more projects, gain visibility, feedback, and recognition.
- Common repository for a group: everyone can directly update the same repository.
  Good for small groups.
- Forks or copies with different owners: anyone can suggest changes, even without
  advance permission. Maintainers approve what they agree with.

Being able to share more easily (going down the above list) is
*transformative* (easier to change something, that is you are not the sole owner)
because it allows projects to scale to a new level.
**This can’t be done without proper tools.**

**In this lesson we will learn how to keep repositories in sync and how to
work with remote repositories on GitHub and other services.** We will
discover and exercise the centralized as well as the forking workflows,
and finally look into how to automate tasks using Git hooks.

.. prereq::

   1. Basic understanding of Git.
   2. You need a `GitHub <https://github.com>`__ account.

   We will do this exercise on `GitHub <https://github.com>`__ but also
   `GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`__ and
   `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org>`__ allow similar workflows and
   basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With this
   material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
   `GitHub <https://github.com>`__. We have chosen to demonstrate a
   number of concepts using examples with
   `GitHub <https://github.com>`__ because it is currently the most
   popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is
   high that you will interact with
   `GitHub <https://github.com>`__-based repositories even if you choose
   to host your Git repository on another platform.

   We also encourage course participants to use our `Nordic research
   software repository platform <https://source.coderefinery.org>`__,
