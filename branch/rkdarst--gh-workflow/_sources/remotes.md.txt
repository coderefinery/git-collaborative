# Concepts around collaboration

```{objectives}
- Be able to decide whether to divide work at the branch level or at the repository level.
```

```{instructor-note}
- 15 min teaching
```


## Motivation

- Someone has given you access to a repository online and you want to contribute?
- We will learn how to make a copy and send changes back.
- Then, we make a "pull request" that allows a review.
- Once we know how code review works, we will be able to propose changes
  to repositories of others and review changes submitted by external
  contributors.


## Commits, branches, repositories, forks, clones

- **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
- **commit**: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier (e.g. `c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e`).
- **branch**: Independent development line. The main development line is often called `main`.
- **tag**: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it later. Like a [commemorative plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commemorative_plaque)
  that you attach to a particular commit (e.g. `phd-printed` or `paper-submitted`).
- **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one.
- **forking**: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not yours) - your
  copy (fork) stays on GitHub/GitLab and you can make changes to your copy.


## Cloning a repository

In order to make a complete copy a whole repository, the `git clone` command can be used. When cloning, all the files, of all or selected branches, of a repository are copied in one operation. Cloning of a repository is of relevance in a few different situations:
* Working on your own, cloning is the operation that you can use to create multiple instances of a repository on, for instance, a personal computer, a server, and a supercomputer.
* The parent repository could be a repository that you or your colleague own. A common use case for cloning is when working together within a smaller team where everyone has read and write access to the same git repository.
* Alternatively, cloning can be made from a public repository of a code that you would like to use. Perhaps you have no intention to work on the code, but would like to stay in tune with the latest developments, also in-between releases of new versions of the code.

## Forking a repository

When a fork is made on GitHub/GitLab a complete copy, of all or selected branches, of the repository is made. The copy will reside under a different account on GitHub/GitLab. Forking of a repository is of high relevance when working with a git repository to which you do not have write access.
* In the fork repository commits can be made to the base branch (`main` or `master`), and to other branches.
* The commits that are made within the branches of the fork repository can be contributed back to the parent repository by means of pull or merge requests.

## Generating from templates and importing

There are two more ways to create "copies" of repositories into your user space:
- A repository can be marked as **template** and new repositories can be
  **generated** from it, like using a cookie-cutter.
  The newly created repository will start with a new history, only one commit, and not
  inherit the history of the template.

- You can **import** a repository from another hosting service or web address.
  This will preserve the history of the imported project.

```{discussion}
- Visit one of the repositories/projects that you have used recently and try to find out
  how many forks exist and where they are.
- In which situations could it be useful to start from a "template" repository by generating?
```


## Synchronizing changes between repositories

- We need a mechanism to communicate changes between the repositories.
- We will **pull** or **fetch** updates **from** remote repositories (we will soon discuss the difference between pull and fetch).
- We will **push** updates **to** remote repositories.
- We will learn how to suggest changes within repositories on GitHub and across repositories (**pull request**).
- Repositories that are forked or cloned do not automatically synchronize themselves:
  We will learn how to update forks (by pulling from the "central" repository).
- A main difference between cloning a repository and forking a repository is that the former is a general operation for generating copies of a repository to different computers, whereas forking is a particular operation implemented on GitHub/GitLab.
