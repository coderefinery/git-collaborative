## Branch naming

- Name your local branches such that you will recognize them 3 months later
- "test", "foo", "debug", "mybranch" are not good
- Give descriptive names to remote branches
- For topic branches we recommend to name them "author/topic" (example `radovan/new-integrator`)
- Then everybody knows who is to be contacted about this branch (e.g. stale branches)
- Also you can easily find "your" branches

```shell
$ git branch -r | grep radovan
```

- Name bugfix branches after the issue/ticket (e.g. `issue-137`)
- For release branches we recommend e.g. `release-2.x` or `stable-2.x`

---

## Always have only one main development line

- Document where it is
- Organize branches according to features, not according to groups of people
- Good: branches `feature-a`, `feature-b`, `feature-c`
- Bad: branches `stockholm`, `san_francisco`, `helsinki`
- Reason: `stockholm`, `san_francisco`, and `helsinki` will either diverge
  (three main development lines) or somebody will spend a heroic effort to keep
  them synchronized

---

## Every commit on the main development line should compile

- Sometimes you want to find a commit in the past that broke some functionality
- When using `git bisect` you will see that it is very helpful if all commits compile
- On the other hand you will see that it is annoying if you hit a commit that does not compile
- This is why we insist so much on a compiling main development line with nice history
- There is no reason to commit broken or unfinished code to the main development line: for this we have branches

---

## Rebase vs. merge

- To illustrate rebasing we consider the following situation
- We want to merge `master`

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/pre-rebase.svg)

Now you know how to do it:

```shell
$ git checkout devel
$ git merge master
```

This creates a merge commit:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/git-branch-08.svg)


But there is an alternative:

```shell
$ git rebase master
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/rebase.svg)

- `git rebase` replays the branch commits `b1` to `b3` on top of `master`
- As if they were committed after `c5`
- It changes history (notice that the commits `b1` to `b3` have been replaced by `b1*` to `b3*`)
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages

### Advantages and disadvantages

- `git rebase` makes "merges" producing a linear history
- When somebody asks you to rebase your work to the work of somebody else you know what this means
- When working with others **do not rebase commits that you have shared**
  (history has changed)
- Reference: "Treehouse of Horror V: Time and Punishment", The Simpsons (1994)

## Branch hygiene

Often we have this situation:

```shell
$ git log --oneline

6e129cf documentation for feature C
05344f6 small fix for feature C
bc11c47 save work on feature C
aa25177 feature B
6b58ba4 feature A
```

But we would prefer to have this history:

```shell
$ git log --oneline

81e100c feature C
aa25177 feature B
6b58ba4 feature A
```

- We can use `git reset --soft aa25177`
- This means that we move our repository back to commit aa25177
  BUT we keep the working tree of the last committed state
- The final state of the actual code is identical
- Alternative to `git reset --soft` is an interactive rebase
- We recommend to create commits on the main development line which are nice logical units
- Commits should be pickable (not too large not too small for a `cherry-pick`)
- Avoid ball-of-mud commits

---

## Git rebase and commit squashing exercise

### Objective

In this exercise we will practice how to squash incomplete commits into one
nice commit and replay it on top of the master branch.


### Motivation

This technique is useful in situations where you need to make changes to a pull
request before it can be integrated.


### Exercise

Start the exercise by forking and cloning [this repository](https://github.com/bast/git-rebase-squash-exercise).

The `haiku` branch represents a feature branch that is to be rebased (moved) and squashed.

On the `haiku` branch you find a script that prints a haiku:

```shell
$ python main.py

This is our haiku:

On a branch ...
                  by Kobayashi Issa

              On a branch
              floating downriver
              a cricket, singing.
```

The haiku is great but the
commit history on
the `haiku` branch is not (on purpose):

```shell
$ git log --oneline

65870f9 fix a copy-paste error
47a007d completed the haiku
a3278e3 another incomplete commit
54fba21 startign to work on it (commit with a typo)
3ff39a1 forgot to add a file
7e1f903 starting working on the haiku
c50a463 initial commit
```

Your task is to rebase the `haiku` branch on top
of `master` and squash the several small "incomplete" commits into one single
self-contained cherry-pickable commit.

In other words instead of this history:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/rebase-exercise-1.svg)

we wish to arrive at this history:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/rebase-exercise-3.svg)

by first rebasing the commits:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/rebase-exercise-2.svg)

and later squashing them.

Verify the steps and the result with `git status` and `git log`.
Verify the history and also that the script still works after the operation.

## [Vincent Driessen model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/nvie-model.png" style="height: 600px;"/>

(c) Vincent Driessen, licensed under CC BY-SA.

- [Link to original post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- Very popular
- Two long-lived branches: `develop` and `master`
- New features are developed on feature branches
- Feature branches branch off from `develop`
- `master` is the latest stable release by definition
- Everything merged to `develop` is ready to be released
- Critique (personal opinion)
    - Naming is unfortunate and often confuses coworkers (rename `develop` to `master` and `master` to `stable`)
    - Model is not ideal if you need to support past versions and publish patches for past versions
- Good if you do not distribute the stable release (e.g. if you run it on your servers)

---

## Alternative: separate branch for each major release

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/branches/tree-model.svg)

- We recommend to name release branches e.g. `release-2.x` or `stable-2.x`
- It is then crystal clear where the main development line is
- Does not require to create new branches for patches of past versions
- Good if you distribute code and support past versions
- Patches need to be applied to the oldest supported release branch and cherry-picked or merged
  "up" to the main line and all supported release branches
- We never merge `master` to release branches
- The `master` branch ideally only receives merges and no direct commits

---

## Document and enforce your branch naming and strategies

- Document recommended branch naming
- Document your branching layout/strategy
- Require your developers to follow it (code review)
- Write-protect your main development line and release branch(es)

---

## Tag your releases

- Tags are also just pointers to commits
- While branches are mutable, tags are (typically) immutable
- Tags can carry extra annotation
- Always tag your releases

```shell
$ git tag                             # list all tags
$ git tag -a v1.5 -m 'my version 1.4' # create annotated tag
$ git tag v1.5                        # create lightweight tag
$ git push origin v1.5                # share tag to upstream (origin)
$ git push origin --tags              # push all tags
```

---

## Use meaningful version numbers

- Use semantic versioning: http://semver.org

---

## Avoiding conflicts

- Conflicts can be avoided if you think and talk with your colleagues before committing
- Think and plan to which branch you will commit to
- Fortran people: modifying common blocks often causes conflicts
- Modifying global data often causes conflicts
- Monolithic entangled spaghetti-code maximizes risk of conflicts
- Modular programing minimizes risk of conflicts
- Ball-of-mud branches for "everything" maximize risk of conflicts
- One branch for one task only
- Resolve conflicts early
- If the branch affects code that is likely to be modified by others, the branch should be short-lived and/or merge often to the main development line

---

## Develop separate features on separate branches

- You create a branch for your new feature that you are working on
- While working on your feature you discover a defect or bug that has nothing to do
  with your new feature
- Or you see some ugly code and want to clean it up
- You are a responsible developer and you do not want to leave this defect
- You decide to fix this defect right on your new branch "while at it"
- This is a **bad idea** - why?

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/confict-resolution/git-fix-1.svg)

- Reasoning
    - If you fix it on your branch other people will not see it
    - You may want to merge it to `master` but you cannot since your new feature is not ready yet
    - Perhaps somebody else will fix it on master in a different way and then it will conflict
      with your new feature
    - Before you commit a change, think: "who needs this change?"
    - Based on the answer select the appropriate branch
    - Develop separate features on separate branches and be very strict and disciplined with this

- Better solution
    - Fix it on `master`, so other developers can see it
    - Than merge it to your development/topic branch

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/confict-resolution/git-fix-2.svg)

- Developing separate features on separate branches minimizes conflicts
- It makes branches shorter-lived
- This again minimizes conflicts

---

## Wrong branch - what now?

- OK I made a commit to the "wrong" branch
- And it is a public branch, what now?
- `git cherry-pick` the commit to the "right" branch

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/confict-resolution/git-fix-3.svg)

---

## Rewinding the master branch

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/confict-resolution/git-split-branch-1.svg)

- You made few commits to the `master` branch
- You then realize that it broke some tests but you have no time now to fix them
- So you wish you had committed them to an experimental branch instead
- You want to move last three commits to a separate branch
- First make sure that your working directory and index are empty
- Then create a new branch (e.g. `feature`)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/confict-resolution/git-split-branch-2.svg)

- Now reset `master` back three commits

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git branch feature  # create feature branch but stay on master
$ git reset --hard c2 # on master
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/confict-resolution/git-split-branch-3.svg)

- Another job well done
- However this should not be done if the commits have already been shared with others

---

## When is a good moment to merge?

- Feature branch merges to `master` typically once (at the end of its lifetime)
- But there may be good reasons for merging branch to `master` more often (release branch)
- Never merge a feature branch into another feature branch (branch pollution; discuss why)
- For modular projects with write-protected `master` and code review and very high discipline
    - You typically should not merge `master` except the occasional `git cherry-pick`
- For entangled projects where most of the development happens directly on `master`
    - It is good to merge `master` to your topic branch often to stay in sync with main development line
    - Merge `master` to your branch ideally should never conflict
    - But it will sometimes, resolve conflicts early

---

## Develop on feature branches

- Keeps bugs away from the main development line
- Divide and conquer: do not create a branch for "everything"
- The more you do on one branch the longer it will take until you can reintegrate it
- The more granular the branches, the shorter lived
- Talk with your colleagues to avoid conflicts

How to test combinations of features?

- I develop `feature-a`
- My colleague develops `feature-b`
- Both are not ready yet to go into the main line
- How can we test them together?
- Do not cross-merge feature branches
- Reason: if `feature-a` becomes ready, it cannot be integrated to the main line
  because it is then diluted with `feature-b`
- It is easy to make soup out of vegetables, it is difficult to separate a vegetable out of a soup
- Test combinations on integration branches
- Integration branches only integrate, we do not "work" on them
- Same holds for testing combinations with the main line
- The main line should ideally be an integration branch
