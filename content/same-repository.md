# Collaborating within the same repository

In this episode, we will learn how to collaborate within the same repository.
We will learn how to cross-reference issues and pull requests, how to review
pull requests, and how to use draft pull requests.

This exercise will form a good basis for collaboration that is suitable for
most research groups.

:::{note}
When you read or hear **pull request**, please think of a **change proposal**.
:::


## Exercise

In this exercise, we will contribute to a repository via a **pull request**.
This means that you propose some change, and then it can be discussed and
accepted (sometimes after requesting further improvements).

::::::{prereq} Exercise preparation

First, we need to get access to some repository to which we will
contribute.

:::::{tabs}
  ::::{tab} Part of team/exercise room
  - Form not too large groups (4-5 persons).
  - Each group needs to appoint someone who will host the shared
    GitHub repository: the *maintainer*.
    This is typically the exercise lead (if available).  Everyone else
    is a *collaborator*.
  - The **maintainer** (one person per group) generates a new repository
    called `centralized-workflow-exercise`
    from the template <https://github.com/coderefinery/recipe-book-template>
    (There is no need to tick *"Include all branches"* for this exercise):
    :::{figure} img/centralized/generate_repo.png
    :alt: Screenshot of generating the exercise repository
    :width: 100%
    :::
  - Then **everyone in your group** needs their GitHub account to be added as collaborator to the exercise repository:
    - Collaborators give their GitHub usernames to their chosen maintainer.
    - Maintainer gives the other group members the newly created GitHub repository URL.
    - Maintainer adds participants as collaborators to their project (Settings -> Collaborators -> Manage access -> Add people).
  ::::

  ::::{tab} Following on your own
  The instructors are the **maintainers**.  All watchers are
  **collaborators**.  This exercise is only possible during our
  livestream courses.
  The preparation typically happens already 1-2 days before.

  :::{admonition} If you have not requested access

  If you have not yet requested access, could you please [open an
  issue in this
  repository](https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose).
  Wait a
  minute for staff to add you, then wait for the invite email to arrive and
  accept the invitation from the email and "unwatch" repositories (below).
  :::

  **Choose only one to work with** (you must have requested access already, see above)

  - Not recorded:
    <https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise>
    (this will not be shown on stream or recorded in our videos, but is public
    on the internet until it is deleted)
  - Recorded: <https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded> (this will be shown on stream and recorded, **your username and comments may appear in the recorded video on YouTube**)
  ::::
:::::

- **Don't forget to accept the invitation**
  - Check <https://github.com/settings/organizations/>
  - Alternatively check the inbox for the email account you registered with
    GitHub. GitHub emails you an invitation link, but if you don't receive it
    you can go to your GitHub notifications in the top right corner. The
    maintainer can also "copy invite link" and share it within the group.

- **Watching and unwatching repositories**
  - Now that you are a collaborator, you get notified about new issues and pull
    requests via email.
  - If you do not wish this, you can "unwatch" a repository (top of
    the project page).
  - However, we recommend watching repositories you are interested
    in. You can learn things from experts just by watching the
    activity that come through a popular project.
  :::{figure} img/centralized/unwatch.png
  :alt: Unwatching a repository

  Unwatch a repository by clicking "Watch" in the repository view,
  then "Participating and @mentions" - this way, you will get
  notifications about your own interactions.

:::{exercise} Exercise: Collaborating within the same repository (25 min)

**Technical requirements** (from installation instructions):
- If you create the commits locally: [Being able to authenticate to GitHub](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/)

**What is familiar** from the previous workshop days (not repeated here):
- Cloning a repository ([previous lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/local-workflow/))
- Creating a branch ([previous lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/))
- Committing a change on the new branch ([previous lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/))
- Submit a pull request towards the main branch ([previous lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/merging/))

**What will be new** in this exercise:
- If you create the changes locally, you will need to **push** them to the remote repository.
- Learning what a protected branch is and how to modify a protected branch: using a pull request.
- Cross-referencing issues and pull requests.
- Practice to review a pull request.
- Learn about the value of draft pull requests.

**Exercise tasks**:
1. In the GitHub repository, open an issue where you describe the change you want to make. Note down the
   issue number since you will need it later.
1. If you work locally and not on GitHub, you need to clone the repository to
   your computer before you can create a new branch (more details in "Solution
   and hints" below).
1. Create a new branch.
1. Make a change to the recipe book on the new branch and in the commit
   cross-reference the issue you opened (see the walk-through below
   for how to do that).
1. If you work locally, push your new branch (with the new commit) to the repository you
   are working on.
1. Open a pull request towards the main branch.
1. Review somebody else's pull request and give constructive feedback. Merge their pull request.
1. Try to create a new branch with some half-finished work and open a draft
   pull request. Verify that the draft pull request cannot be merged since it
   is not meant to be merged yet.
:::


## Solution and hints

### (1) Opening an issue

This is done through the GitHub web interface.  For example, you could
give the name of the recipe you want to add (so that others don't add
the same one).  It is the "Issues" tab.


### (2) Create a new branch.

If on GitHub, you can make the branch in the web interface
({external:doc}`commits`).  If working locally, you need to follow
{external:doc}`local-workflow`.


### (3) Make a change adding the recipe

Add a new file with the recipe in it.  Commit the file. In the commit
message, include the note about the issue number, saying that this
will close that issue (right below here we show how).


#### Cross-referencing issues and pull requests

Each issue and each pull request gets a number and you can cross-reference them.

When you open an issue, note down the issue number (in this case it is `#2`):
:::{figure} img/same-repository/issue-number.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border
:alt: Each issue gets a number
:::

You can reference this issue number in a commit message or in a pull request, like in this
commit message:
```text
this is the new recipe; fixes #2
```

If you forget to do that in your commit message, you can also reference the issue
in the pull request description. And instead of `fixes` you can also use `closes` or `resolves`
or `fix` or `close` or `resolve` (case insensitive).

Here are all the keywords that GitHub recognizes:
<https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords>

Then observe what happens in the issue once your commit gets merged: it will
automatically close the issue and create a link between the issue and the
commit. This is very useful for tracking what changes were made in response to
which issue and to know from when **until when precisely** the issue was open.


### (4) Push to GitHub as a new branch

This is only necessary if you created the changes locally. If you created the
changes directly on GitHub, you can skip this step.

Push the branch to the repository. You should end up with a branch
visible in the GitHub web view (if you are unsure how, see
{external:doc}`local-workflow`).

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} VS Code
In VS Code, you can "publish the branch" to the remote repository by clicking
the cloud icon in the bottom left corner of the window:
:::{figure} img/same-repository/vscode-publish-branch.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border
:alt: Publishing a branch in VS Code
:::
::::

::::{group-tab} Command line
If you have a local branch `my-branch` and you want to push it to the remote
and make it visible there, first verify what your remote is:
```console
$ git remote --verbose

origin	git@github.com:USER/centralized-workflow-exercise.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:USER/centralized-workflow-exercise.git (push)
```

In this case the remote is called `origin` and refers to the address
git@github.com:USER/centralized-workflow-exercise.git.  Both can be used
interchangeably. Make sure it points to the right repository, ideally a
repository that you can write to.

Now that you have a remote, you can push your branch to it:
```console
$ git push origin my-branch
```
This will create a new branch on the remote repository with the same name as
your local branch.

You can also do this:
```console
$ git push --set-upstream origin my-branch
```
This will connect the local branch and the remote branch so that in the future
you can just type `git push` and `git pull` without specifying the branch name
(but this depends on your Git configuration).


**Troubleshooting**

If you don't have a remote yet, you can add it with (adjust `ADDRESS` to your repository address):
```console
$ git remote add origin ADDRESS
```

ADDRESS is the part that you copy from here:
:::{figure} img/same-repository/clone-address.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border
:alt: Copying the clone address from GitHub
:::

If the remote points to the wrong place, you can change it with:
```console
$ git remote set-url origin NEWADDRESS
```
::::
:::::


### (5) Open a pull request towards the main branch

This is done through the GitHub web interface.  We saw this
in a [previous lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/merging/).


### (6) Reviewing pull requests

You review through the GitHub web interface.

Checklist for reviewing a pull request:
- Be kind, on the other side is a human who has put effort into this.
- Be constructive: if you see a problem, suggest a solution.
- Towards which branch is this directed?
- Is the title descriptive?
- Is the description informative?
- Scroll down to see commits.
- Scroll down to see the changes.
- If you get incredibly many changes, also consider the license or copyright
  and ask where all that code is coming from.
- Again, be kind and constructive.
- Later we will learn how to suggest changes directly in the pull request.

If someone is new, it's often nice to say something encouraging in the
comments before merging (even if it's just "thanks").  If all is good
and there's not much else to say, you could merge directly.


### (7) Draft pull requests

Try to create a draft pull request:
:::{figure} img/same-repository/draft-pr.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border
:alt: Creating a draft pull request
::::

Verify that the draft pull request cannot be merged until it is marked as ready
for review:
:::{figure} img/same-repository/draft-pr-wip.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border
:alt: Draft pull request cannot be merged
::::

Draft pull requests can be useful for:
- **Feedback**: You can open a pull request early to get feedback on your work without
  signaling that it is ready to merge.
- **Information**: They can help communicating to others that a change is coming up and in
  progress.


### What is a protected branch? And how to modify it?

A protected branch on GitHub or GitLab is a branch that cannot (accidentally)
deleted or force-pushed to. It is also possible to require that a branch cannot
be directly pushed to or modified, but that changes must be submitted via a
pull request.

To protect a branch in your own repository, go to "Settings" -> "Branches".



### Summary

- We used all the same pieces that we've learned previously.
- But we successfully contributed to a **collaborative project**!
- The pull request allowed us to contribute without changing directly:
  this is very good when it's not mainly our project.

:::{discussion} Let's clarify typical questions
**What is the difference between `git pull` and a pull request?**
- `git pull` is a command that fetches changes from a remote repository and
  merges them into the current branch.
- Pull request: change proposal. It might have been named this way because
  after you accept a pull request, internally it git pulls the changes from
  the branch containing the change proposal.

**What is the difference between a pull request and an issue?**
- Pull request is a mechanism to suggest and review changes.
- An issue is a place where we note and discuss problems or ideas.
- Both get a number and they can reference each other but that's all they have in common.
- [Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  
**What is the practical difference between branch + pull and fork + pull?**
- The practical difference between branch + pull and fork + pull lies in how collaboration is structured in a Git-based workflow.
- Branch + Pull (Single Repository Contribution) : Used when contributing to a repository where you have direct write access.
- Process:
     1. Clone the main repository.
     2. Create a new branch in the same repository.
     3. Make changes and commit them.
     4. Push the branch to the same repository.
     5. Open a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch.
- Fork + Pull (External Contribution): Used when contributing to a repository where you do not have write access.
- Process:
     1. Fork the repository (create your own copy under your GitHub account).
     2. Clone your forked repository locally.
     3. Create a new branch in your fork.
     4. Make changes and commit them.
     5. Push the branch to your fork.
     6. Open a Pull Request from your fork to the original repository.
