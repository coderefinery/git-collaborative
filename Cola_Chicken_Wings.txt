Cola Chicken Wings Method
1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the chicken wings and blanch for 2 minutes, then remove.
2. Rinse the chicken wings under clean water to remove any foam, then drain thoroughly.
3. Cut the scallions into sections and peel the ginger before slicing it.
4. Heat oil in a wok over high heat until itâ€™s about 40% hot, then add the cloves, star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, and cinnamon bark.
5. Add the chicken wings, stir-fry for 1 minute, then pour in the cola and some water.
6. Add the dark soy sauce, stir well, cover with a lid, and reduce to medium heat. Simmer for 20 minutes.
7. Uncover, season with salt, then turn up to high heat and cook for about 3 minutes until the sauce becomes thick and coats the chicken wings.
